      <h1>Redistricting and Polarization in Congress</h1>
      <section>

          <p>
            With redistricing underway after the 2020 census there are many
            concerns about gerrymandering, redrawing congressional districts in
            favor of one party. In 2010 the Republican party explicitly engaged
            in this behavior with a strategy known as REDMAP, designed to give
            them an electoral advantage in the House. Concerns are that both
            parties will engage in this behavior in 2020 where they have control
            over redistricting leading to less swing districts.

            There are also concerns that this will lead to a more polzarized
            congress. As a recent

            explored, districts that are easier for one party to win can lead to
            represenatives with more partisan and extreme views. One measure of
            partisanship is the DW NOMINATE Scale. This scale goes from -1 to 1,
            with -1 being the most liberal and 1 being the most conservative (a
            score of 0 would be a true moderate). Using these scores we can
            examine whether congress is getting more polarized and if
            redistricing has had an impact on that.

          Over the last few decades House Republicans have become more

          from gerrymandering.

          Its clear from using nominate scores that the divide in congress is
          deepening. However its hard to attribute that divide directly to
          gerrymandering. One way if its had an impact is to look at how each
          state produced their maps and whether that led to more polarized
          represenatives from that state. In most states the state legislature
          draws the map. That legislature can be fully controlled by one party
          or be under split control. Additionally some states use courts or a
          commission to draw the maps. If gerrymandering has an impact on
          polarization we'd expect to see states where the maps were drawn by
          one party to be more polzarized.

        <h2>Did Gerrymandering Lead to a More Polarized Congress?</h2>
        <legend>
          While Republican controlled redistricting lead to slightly more
          partisan represenatives in congress, Court decided boundaries had
          basically the same outcome and comissions did little better.

          Notes: The average ideology score is based on the average for all
          Democrats or Republicans from states that practiced that redistricting
          process between 2012 and 2022. States with one congressional district
          were excluded from this data. Additionally some states had maps that
          were struck down or replaced throughout the decade. In those cases the
          state was categorized by whatever map it used the longest. Source:

          Using courts or commissions to draw districts is often seen as a
          solution to gerrymandering. The fact that there were among the most
          polarized districts is a big blow to that theory. Republican drawn
          districts were also more polarized compared to districts drawn by
          legislatures controlled by Democrats or that were jointedly
          controlled.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this graph doesn't take into account the partisan leaning of
          states. We would expect states that are more conservative to have more
          conservative members of congress while also having legislatures
          controlled by Republicans. It could be that court drawn districts are
          in states that are very conservative or liberal as well. Luckily there
          are various swing states, states that are neither very conservative or
          liberal, where the districts were drawn using the different methods.
          We might be able to get a better idea of the impact of these different
          strategies by looking at those swing states specifically.

              In the 2000's polarization in congress had already been on the
              rise for some time. A darker hue of for a district means that
              district produced, on average, more extreme represenatives
              (regardless of party).

              That trend continued in the 2010's. We can also see that swing
              states differed in how ideologically extreme their represenatives
              were depending on how redistricting was done.

              In swing states where the Republican party was in charge of
              redistricting in 2010, like Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and
              Wisconsin, represenatives tended to be more extreme in their
              views.

              Swing states where a federal or state court did the redistricting

              represenatives.

          Though redistricting through comissions and courts were thought of as
          a strategy to prevent gerrymandering those strategies seem to have
          mixed results when it comes to preventing polarization.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is pretty clear though that Republican drawn districts tend to
          produce more polarized represenatives. However whether that's a direct
          result of gerrymandering isn't clear. This election cycle both parties
          seem set on using redistricting to increase their representation, the
          impact this has on congress over the next decade will be telling.
