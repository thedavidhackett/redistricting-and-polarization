    <h1>Redistricting and Polarization in Congress</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        After every census the each state in the U.S redraws its legislative
        boundaries to determine the districts that its congress people will
        represent. These districts can be drawn by a commission, courts, or,
        most commonly, the state legislature. Since state legislatures are often
        controled by a single political party a common concern with
        redistricting is gerrymandering, drawing districts to benefit one party.
        Historically this has been seen as a tool to increase the representation
        of one party. In 2010, the Republican party made a conscious effort to
        gerrymander districts to this end, a strategy they called REDMAP. After
        the 2020 census there is concern that both parties will engage in this
        practice in the states where they control the redistricing process.
        While both parties gerrymandering could be a zero sum game for
        increasing their power, a recent New York Times article posited that
        this process is increasing the partisan divide between democrats and
        republicans. Essentially if districts are easier for Republicans and
        Democrats to win, ie they aren't swing districts that could go either
        way, those districts produce represenatives with more extreme and
        partisan views.

        One measure of partisanship is the DW NOMINATE Scale. This scale
        measures the conservative and liberal voting patterns of members of
        congress. The score ranges from -1 to 1, with higher scores meaning the
        represenative is more conservative and lower scores meaning they are
        more liberal. A 0 would indicate a moderate. Using these scores we can
        examine whether congress is getting more polarized and if redistricing
        has had an impact on that.

              In the 2000s partisanship had already been on the rise for
              sometime. A darker hue of
              <span style="color: #6a51a3; font-weight: bold">purple</span> for
              a district means that district produced, on average, more extreme
              represenatives (regardless of party).

              That trend continued in the 2010s. But how extreme a states
              represenatives were in their partisanship could be traced to how
              redistricting was decided in that state.

            <p>
              In swing states where the Republican party was in charge of
              redistricting in 2010, like Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and
              Wisconsin, represenatives tended to be more extreme in their
              partisanship.

              Swing states where both parties had some control over the
              redistricing process, such as Iowa, Maine, New Jersey, and Oregon,
              tended to produce less partisan represenatives.

              Swing states where a federal or state court did the redistricting
              were a mixed bag. Minnesota and Nevada produced more moderate
              represenatives, but Colorado and New Mexico produced more partisan
              represenatives.
